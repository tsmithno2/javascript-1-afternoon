## Directions

Complete all the activities inside of `./practice.js` to make the spec runner pass it's tests. In order to check the progress of the spec runner, open `./SpecRunner.html` with your browser. Remember to commit and push your code often. Good luck!

## Tips and Tricks

One of the biggest tools at the developer's disposal is the browser's built-in debugger. To use it, open `./index.html` with your browser. Another great tool for small and isolated pieces of code is <a href="http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#">Python Tutor</a>. Just make sure to change the code to `JavaScript ES6`.
